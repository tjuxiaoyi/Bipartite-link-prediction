# Bipartite-link-prediction
Ten kinds of usual link prediction methods in bipartite network<br/>
This repository is used to save ten kinds fo method.I wrote those code by referencing the code from github. I get it from my teacher, 
so I can't give it url here.But I will put the code in my repository, if you can't understood my code, you can also reference this code<br/>
Because the code of the original version dosen't match my demand,so I rewrite it. In my code, every prediction methods will calculate the same<br/>
submatrix respectively, if you want to get the result of ten methods at the same time, I recommend you to change my code to return the result <br/>
in one function. It will save a lot of time.<br/>
I also upload the paper where you can find the calculate formula for that you can easily understand the code<br/>
因为个人使用的需要，我将一个可以同时返回十种二分网络链路预测算法结果的函数拆分为10个函数，如果你有需要，可以重新改写为一个函数，以节约时间。<br/>
我把算法来源的文章和参考的源代码一并放在仓库里，作为参考。
